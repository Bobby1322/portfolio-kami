## Explanation

BlocJams is a digital music player like that I developed to enhance my frontend web development skills. I started by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, added styling and responsiveness using CSS, and then implemented interactivity with JavaScript.

## Problem

The specs for this project were to create a working music player online and create the interface to go with it. At the time, this was as equally scary, as they were exciting.  

## Solution

To practice different methods and approaches to this problem, I first built out the tool in DOM scirpting, then later again in JQuery, although both of these worked, a more efficient solution remanded: Angular. 

## Results

After reworking this project in Angular, I was very happy to see to decrease in code and increase in user experince. BlocJams is a simple, clean, and fun way to listen to music across all devices!
