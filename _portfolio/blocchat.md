## Explanation

BlocChat is an any-to-any chat site designed to promote collaboration and communication. This was my firts project to use an external database (Firebase).

## Problem

When presented with this project, all I was asked was to create an online chat tool, which allows for users to share messages back and forth in real-time. As I have been a user of various different types of chat systems over the year, from AIM to Slack, I wanted to develop something that was simple to use, with a clean interface.

## Solution

To ensure a fluid and real-time experience, I used Angular as the root of my project. With some HTML and CSS, I then created a clear interface, and then added in some additional features, such as username creation, chat room creation, and timestamps. Finally, I connected it to Google's Firebase database system.

## Results

Once pushing this project live, I was beyound excited to share it with my roommate, friends, and family for a real world test. All-in-all, I am thrilled by the finished project. This will be something I plan to revisit in the future.
